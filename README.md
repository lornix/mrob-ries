RIES Equation Generator Program from Robert Munafo (www.mrob.com).

This is an amazing program which will generate formulae which return a given value, possibly using a limited range of functions, numbers and operations.  (Want to figure out how to get the value 57 using only +-/* and 7's?  It'll do it!)

Check out Mr. Munafo's website too, his passion for numbers is contagious!  (I was already infected, I keep coming back to his site to read more).
